## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used to analyze any election by finding data on vote counts, locations with the most turnouts, and how well candidates have done during the election. With that base script, we are able to see the other side of the results as well; this would be the candidate with the lowest votes, counties with lower turnouts, etc. We can further modify our script to find data such as which county each candidate had the most votes. This would tell us which county favored which candidate.
